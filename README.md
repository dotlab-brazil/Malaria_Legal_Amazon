# Malaria Notifications Dataset in the Legal Amazon, Brazil (2003-2022): A Comprehensive Resource for Research and Surveillance

This dataset provides information on notifications of confirmed cases of Malaria. The data used in this study is derived from compulsory notifications stored in the Malaria Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Malaria), covering the period from 2003 to 2022. By making this dataset available, it is expected that researchers will be better equipped to develop effective strategies to mitigate and eradicate malaria in the region.
